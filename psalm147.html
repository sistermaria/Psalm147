	<h2>Psalm 147</h2>
	
	<div> Praise the Lord; </div>
	 <div>the Lord is gracious;</div>
	<div> sing to our God, a God who so claims our love;</div>
	 <div>praise is his right.</div>
	 <div>The Lord is rebuilding Jerusalem,</div>
	 <div>is calling the banished sons of Israel home;</div>
	  <div>he it is that heals the broken heart,</div>
	 <div> and binds up its wounds. </div>
	  <div>Does he not know the number of the stars,</div>
	  <div>and call each by its name? </div> 
	 <div> How great a Lord is ours, how magnificent his strength,</div>
	 <div> how inscrutable his wisdom! </div>
	  <div>The Lord is the defender of the oppressed,</div>
	 <div> and lays the wicked low in the dust.</div> 
	 <div> Strike up, then, in thanksgiving to the Lord,</div>
	 <div> with the harp’s music praise our God;  the God who curtains heaven with cloud,</div>
	  <div>and lays up a store of rain for the earth,</div>
	  <div>who clothes the mountain-sides with grass,</div>
	 <div> with corn for man’s need, gives food to the cattle,</div>
	 <div> food to the young ravens that cry out to him.  Not the well-mounted warrior is his choice</div>
	  <div> not the swift runner wins his favour; </div>
	  <div>the Lord’s favour is for those who fear him,</div>
	  <div>and put their trust in his divine mercy.</div>
	  </body>
